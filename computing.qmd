## Command line terminal

### macOS
macOS is built on the foundation of [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) and comes with a perfectly capable command line app in Terminal. There are some other options out there, but Terminal is just fine.

Since 2019 the default shell in macOS is [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) instead of [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/). The differences between zsh and bash should not affect beginners too much. However, you can download an updated version of bash. The best way to do this is with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is the easiest way to install many command line packages on macOS such as Git, and so it is a good idea to install it. Read about how to install Homebrew through the Terminal app on the homepage.

### Windows
Windows does not come with a unix shell installed. You can do this via [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org). This will install both the bash shell and git. See the [Carpentries](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#the-bash-shell) for installation instructions.

## Git
See [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git) for a good guide to downloading git for macOS and Windows.

### macOS
Git may already be on your computer by default, but the git version that comes with macOS is quite out of date. The easiest way to get the newer version of git is through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). If you have Homebrew installed, open a Terminal window and do the following:

1. `git --version` – check current version of git on the computer
2. Look at current version of Git at https://git-scm.com
3. `brew install git` – download git with Homebrew
4. Quit terminal and reopen it to start new session
5. `‌git --version` – check to see that installation worked.

### Windows
Install git with [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org).

## GitHub
Register for an account on [GitHub](https://github.com)

## R and RStudio
- [Download R from CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org). R 4.3.2 is currently the newest release. It is expected that you will have a version greater than or equal to 4.3.
- [Download RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).
