This page provides a number of general resources for the main technologies we will be using in the course. More specific resources about the weekly topics are listed on the page for those weeks.

## Digital Humanities
[Humanities Commons - Hcommons](https://hcommons.org) is doing a lot of interesting things to build open source infrastructure for the Humanities in general. Their blog, called [Platypus](https://team.hcommons.org) discusses the why and how of what they are doing.

The question of what is Digital Humanities is ever present. In fact, there is a [website](http://whatisdigitalhumanities.com) that automatically provides different answers. Digital Humanities is also perpetually seen as the future as [Cameron Blevins](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/77) noted in 2016.

Writing on or about Digital Humanities is quite widespread and diverse. Here are some useful places to start, some of which we will read during the semester.

- Romein et al, "State of the Field: Digital History," *History* 105, (2020): 291--312. [https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-229X.12969](https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-229X.12969)
- The *Debates in the Digital Humanities* series published by University of Minnesota Press and hosted at [The Graduate Center at CUNY](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu) has a fairly exhaustive range of discussions spanning from 2013 to 2023.
- A more theoretical discussion of how Digital Humanities affects the study of History can be found in [*History & Theory* vol 61, issue 4: Changing Narratives, Changing Methods, Changing Narrators](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/14682303/2022/61/4).

As far as tutorials for digital tools and technologies, two good places to start looking are [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) and [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org).

## Markdown and plain text
Markdown is widely used as a way to add markup to plain text documents and to write for the web. It was developed by [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) in the early 2000s. Its use has exploded since 2010 and there are now a varity of "flavors" of markdown that have more features than the original version. Mostly you do not need to worry about this.

Guides to Markdown syntax can easily be found on the internet. [Markdown Guide](https://markdownguide.offshoot.io/basic-syntax/) provides a good overview of the basic syntax. The [Quarto docs](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) show the flavor of Markdown used by Quarto.

Good places to start for the why and how of writing in plain text for academic writing is Kieran Healy's [The Plain Person’s Guide to Plain Text Social Science](https://kieranhealy.org/publications/plain-person-text/) and Programming Historians lesson on [Sustainable Authorship in Plain Text using Pandoc and Markdown](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown).

## Command line
- [Programming Historian: Introduction to the Bash Command Line](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-bash)
- [Software Carpentry - The Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)
- [Hartl, Learn Enough Command Line to be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial)
	- Very good basic tutorial and guide that can be used as a good reference.
- [Bates, Conquering the Command Line](http://conqueringthecommandline.com/book)
	- More in depth than *Learning Enough* and discusses more advanced commands.
- [Sean Kross, The Unix Workbench](https://seankross.com/the-unix-workbench/)

## Git and GitHub
- [Software Carpentry - Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
- [Chacon, Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
- [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en)
- [Jenny Bryan, Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](http://happygitwithr.com)

## R
There are innumerable freely available resources and tutorials on learning R for data analysis and visualization, but the best starting place is Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund, [R for Data Science (2nd Edition)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz) (O'Reilly, 2023). It is an essential resource that I continue to check whenever I am working in R and forget how to do things.

A good tutorial on R from a Humanities/Social Sciences perspective is [Data Carpentry - R for Social Scientists](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/). Another good option is [Software Carpentry - R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/).

[Posit](https://posit.co), the company that makes RStudio, publishes [cheatsheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/) for the set of [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) packages we will be using during the course.

Two great resources on visualization are Kieran Healy, [Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction](https://socviz.co) (Princeton University Press, 2018) and Claus Wilke, [Fundamentals of Data Visualization ](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/) (O'Reilly 2019). Both provide guidance on how to make effective visualizations for the Humanities and Social Sciences.

Another set of great resources for visualization with ggplot2 are by Cédric Scherer. His blog post, [A ggplot2 Tutorial for Beautiful Plotting in R](https://www.cedricscherer.com/2019/08/05/a-ggplot2-tutorial-for-beautiful-plotting-in-r/) is both a great starting point and great as a quick reference. His workshop, [Graphic Design with ggplot2](https://rstudio-conf-2022.github.io/ggplot2-graphic-design/) at the 2022 RStudio conference is a really nice tutorial on making advanced visualizations.

## Quarto
- The [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) is very good and thorough.
- For an extensive list of resources on Quarto see [Awesome Quarto](https://github.com/mcanouil/awesome-quarto).
