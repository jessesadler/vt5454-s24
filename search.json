    "text": "Digital Humanities\nHumanities Commons - Hcommons is doing a lot of interesting things to build open source infrastructure for the Humanities in general. Their blog, called Platypus discusses the why and how of what they are doing.\nThe question of what is Digital Humanities is ever present. In fact, there is a website that automatically provides different answers. Digital Humanities is also perpetually seen as the future as Cameron Blevins noted in 2016. The Digital Humanities Literacy Guidebook provides a good overview of the breadth of Digital Humanities.\nWriting on or about Digital Humanities is quite widespread and diverse. Here are some useful places to start, some of which we will read during the semester.\n\nRomein et al, “State of the Field: Digital History,” History 105, (2020): 291–312. https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-229X.12969\nThe Debates in the Digital Humanities series published by University of Minnesota Press and hosted at The Graduate Center at CUNY has a fairly exhaustive range of discussions spanning from 2013 to 2023.\nA more theoretical discussion of how Digital Humanities affects the study of History can be found in History & Theory vol 61, issue 4: Changing Narratives, Changing Methods, Changing Narrators.\n\nAs far as tutorials for digital tools and technologies, two good places to start looking are The Carpentries and Programming Historian.\nThere are many lists of Digital Humanities and Digital History tools, projects, tutorials, and data sources. Here are a couple Awesome lists:\n- Awesome Digital Humanities - Awesome Digital History - Awesome Research Tools - Awesome Reproducible Research",

Below is a partial list of text editors, but there are many out there.\n\nCross platform\n\nVisual Studio Code is much more than a text editor, but it can also be made into a good text editor for plain text and Markdown. It is free and open source and worthy of a download to check out.\nA paid alternative is Sublime Text.\n\n\n\nmacOS\n\nBBEdit is over 30 years old and still going strong. It is available for purchase, but you can go quite far with the free version.\nCotEditor is a modern open source text editor that is very clean looking.\nChime is another open source option.\n\n\n\nWindows\n\nA classic text editor for Windows is Notepad++.",

    "text": "Markdown and plain text\nMarkdown is widely used as a way to add markup to plain text documents and to write for the web. It was developed by John Gruber in the early 2000s. Its use has exploded since 2010 and there are now a variety of “flavors” of markdown that have more features than the original version. Mostly you do not need to worry about this.\nGuides to Markdown syntax can easily be found on the internet. Markdown Guide provides a good overview of the basic syntax. The Quarto docs show the flavor of Markdown used by Quarto. Most/many Markdown editors, especially those that focus on academic writing, depend upon Pandoc, which attempts to be a universal document converter. The Pandoc documents do not make for particularly fun reading, but they are a good resource when digging into the weeds.\nGood places to start for the why and how of writing in plain text for academic writing is Kieran Healy’s The Plain Person’s Guide to Plain Text Social Science and Programming Historians lesson on Sustainable Authorship in Plain Text using Pandoc and Markdown.",

    "text": "R\nThere are innumerable freely available resources and tutorials on learning R for data analysis and visualization, but the best starting place is Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund, R for Data Science (2nd Edition) (O’Reilly, 2023). It is an essential resource that I continue to check whenever I am working in R and forget how to do things.\nA good tutorial on R from a Humanities/Social Sciences perspective is Data Carpentry - R for Social Scientists. Another good option is Software Carpentry - R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis. A more general intro to R from the perspective of someone more used to spreadsheets is Julie Lowndes and Allison Horst, R for Excel Users.\nPosit, the company that makes RStudio, publishes cheatsheets for the set of tidyverse packages we will be using during the course. If you have a question about R you can ask or look for similar questions on the Posit Community.\nIt might be useful to keep The tidyverse style guide handy as you are getting used to writing R code. It provides some basic tips for how to style your code to make it more consistent and easier to read.\nTwo great resources on visualization are Kieran Healy, Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction (Princeton University Press, 2018) and Claus Wilke, Fundamentals of Data Visualization (O’Reilly 2019). Both provide guidance on how to make effective visualizations for the Humanities and Social Sciences. Hadley Wickham, the creator of ggplot2, Danielle Navarro, and Thomas Lin Pedersen have a third edition of the book ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis. It is a very good reference.\nAnother set of great resources for visualization with ggplot2 are by Cédric Scherer. His blog post, A ggplot2 Tutorial for Beautiful Plotting in R is both a great starting point and great as a quick reference. His workshop, Graphic Design with ggplot2 at the 2022 RStudio conference is a really nice tutorial on making advanced visualizations.\nYou can also look at a series of notes/overviews that I have written on the tidyverse and visualization with ggplot2.\nTwo good ways to keep up with what is going on with R and the R community is to subscribe to the R Weekly RSS feed to get a currated list of posts about R. Another great project for learning R and seeing some examples is Tidy Tuesday a community driven weekly event to analyze and visualize a given data set.",

    "text": "What are the benefits of writing in plain text?\nWriting in plain text may seem odd at first, and it confronts the beginner with a number of issues compared to word processing applications such as Microsoft Word that use a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) interface. However, there are a number of advantages to using plain text documents that make the initial discomfort worth it.\n\nSustainability: Plain text documents are sustainable. They will be able to be read and displayed by a computer as long as we have such technology. They are not dependent on a proprietary format like docx.\nLight weight: Plain text documents are incredibly lightweight. Word processors add all sorts of formatting characters to provide a WYSIWYG experience that increase the file size and add complexity to the whole process of writing. Try opening a hundred page document in Word and then try opening the same document in a plain text editor. The latter will open instantaneously.\nThe power of a text editor: With a text editor application you can perform all sorts of complex search and search and replace functionality across multiple documents at the same time.\nThe web: The internet is created using plain text documents. If you want to write for the web, you should be writing in plain text.\nAdding formatting with markup languages: If the lack of formatting is a benefit, how do you get plain text documents to have the formatting you want in a document? The answer is to use a markup language. The markup language of the web is HTML, but other common markup languages used to write for academic purposes are Markdown and latex. With these markup languages you can create complex documents that serve the needs of academics well.",

    "text": "Why should I learn markdown?\n\nThe Markdown syntax is easy to learn and is designed to be human readable, meaning the syntax does not distract from the text itself.\nMarkdown is the most widely used markup language for writing on the web. Its popularity also means that it is easy to find applications that will render Markdown to styled text.\nMarkdown provides a good feature set for most types of historical writing: headings, lists, italic, bold, links, and footnotes gets you pretty far. It, thus, makes it much easier to write in plain text instead of with a world processor. See above for the benefits of plain text.\nMarkdown is the basis for RMarkdown and Quarto, the literate programming languages we will use in this course. This document is written in Markdown.",

    "text": "Why should I learn a programming language for data analysis and visualization?\nThere are many reasons why you might want to use a programming language for data analysis and visualization instead of spreadsheets or a GUI (graphical user interface) program, but first it is worth conceding that learning and using a programming language has a much steeper learning curve than the GUI alternatives. Nevertheless, this course argues that it is worth the effort. Benefits include:\n\nReproducibility: With a programming language you can document your analysis in a script that can be reproduced by others. This is not possible with a point-and-click interface of a GUI application or a spreadsheet. Excel error due to miss-clicking are well known.\nSeparation of data and analysis: In a spreadsheet your data and your analysis are done in the same place. This can make it easy to unknowingly introduce errors into your data. With a programming language all analysis is done on a copy of the data, making it easier to ensure the data is correct. This also has the benefit that you can can make mistakes in your data analysis with a programming language without consequence. If you run into problems, get an error, or mess something up, it is ok. Your data remains safe and sound just as you left it.\nYou are in charge: Spreadsheets often try to guess the formatting of data, which is another source of errors. Such errors are common, especially in dealing with dates. Scientists even had to rename a gene to deal with the issue. For historians, the fact that Excel does not natively support dates before 1900. With a programming language you have much greater control.",

    "text": "Why are we learning R in this course? Why not Python?\nIn this course we will learn R for data analysis and visualization. A reasonable question to ask is why R and why not Python. To begin with, I think it is fair to say that R and Python are both good choices for doing Digital Humanities. I should also say that the main reasons we are learning R in this course is that I am more comfortable with R than with Python. But there are a couple of reasons that I think R is a good choice for Digital Humanities.\n\nR is a domain specific programming language that was designed for Statistics. It was designed to work with data. The main types of rectangular data common to Digital Humanities is at home in R. Python is a more general programming language. This has some real benefits, but it also means that data analysis and visualization is not at the core of the language in the same way as is true for R.\nR is easier to install than Python, R packages are easier to manage than Python packages, and the RStudio IDE provides a first-class environment for data analysis.\nA strong, open, and welcoming community has been built around data analysis and reproducible research with R. A good example of this is Tidy Tuesday, a weekly community driven data science project.",

They provide a different ways of analyzing data from what is known as base R. However, the popularity of the tidyverse means there is little drawback to learning it before or in the place of base R.

Two advantages of Quarto over RMarkdown are that Quarto can be used by more than just R and it provides a more consistent interface for writing a wide variety of outputs including R scripts, journal articles, slides, websites, and books. Quarto is well integrated into RStudio and familiarity with Quarto documents from the beginning of the course should lessen the cognitive load for making a website at the end of the course.",

The demise of the app formerly known as Twitter in 2022 and 2023 makes this even more plain. It is useful to have a personal website that you can point people towards and that you can use as a showcase for you work. Or it can just be a place for you to do what you want.

A great and longstanding macOS text editor is BBEdit, which can be purchased, but it offers a very generous free mode. Here is a comparison chart of of what you get with the free version. A classic text editor for Windows is Notepad++. A popular cross-platform text editor that is freely available is Visual Studio Code. There are many other options. Feel free to check them out.\n\n\nMarkdown\n\nJohn Gruber’s introduction of Markdown and its syntax\nMarkdown style guide: Quarto docs\nMarkdown Style Guide\nMost/many Markdown editors, especially those that focus on academic writing, depend upon Pandoc, which attempts to be a universal document converter.\n\n\n\nOther markup options\n\nThe main other option for writing in Markdown or a Markdown based system is LaTeX. Overleaf is a LaTeX editor created specifically for collaboration in academia.\n\n\n\nNote taking apps and zettelkasten\nThere is currently a bit of a renaissance in note taking apps that are designed around the basic ideas of zettelkasten. Most of the apps are Markdown editors that provide a way to create internal links between your notes and display incoming and outgoing links. Zettlr is just one example. It is nice because it is open source, cross platform, and designed with academics in mind. But this does not mean that it is necessarily the best for you. Another hugely popular free (but not open source) and cross platform option is Obsidian.\n\n\nOther options\nDevonThink is more of a do it all database app for macOS, but it can certainly be used as the foundation of organizing your research and note taking.",
