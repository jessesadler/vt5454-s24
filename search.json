    "text": "Digital Humanities\nHumanities Commons - Hcommons is doing a lot of interesting things to build open source infrastructure for the Humanities in general. Their blog, called Platypus, discusses the why and how of what they are doing.\nThe question of what Digital Humanities is is ever present. In fact, there is a website that provides different answers. Digital Humanities is also perpetually seen as the future as Cameron Blevins noted in 2016. The Digital Humanities Literacy Guidebook provides a good overview of the breadth of Digital Humanities.\nWriting on or about Digital Humanities is quite widespread and diverse. Here are some useful places to start, some of which we will read during the semester.\n\nRomein et al, “State of the Field: Digital History,” History 105, (2020): 291–312. https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-229X.12969\nThe Debates in the Digital Humanities series published by University of Minnesota Press and hosted at The Graduate Center at CUNY has a fairly exhaustive range of discussions spanning from 2013 to 2023.\nA more theoretical discussion of how Digital Humanities affects the study of History can be found in History & Theory vol 61, issue 4: Changing Narratives, Changing Methods, Changing Narrators.\n\nAs far as tutorials for digital tools and technologies, two good places to start looking are The Carpentries and Programming Historian.\nThere are many lists of Digital Humanities and Digital History tools, projects, tutorials, and data sources. Here are a couple Awesome lists:\n\nAwesome Digital Humanities\nAwesome Digital History\nAwesome Research Tools\nAwesome Reproducible Research\n\nAn invaluable source for finding Digital Humanities projects is the online journal Reviews in Digital Humanities. I recommend looking through the reviews by topic or method, which includes a quite large collection of DH projects devoted to Public Humanities.",

Its use has exploded since 2010 and there are now a variety of “flavors” of markdown that have more features than the original version. Mostly you do not need to worry about this. See the Markdown Syntax Guide for an overview.\nGuides to Markdown syntax can easily be found on the internet. Programming Historian: Getting Started with Markdown by Sarah Simpkin is a good place to start. Markdown Guide provides a good overview of the basic syntax. The Quarto docs show the flavor of Markdown used by Quarto. Most/many Markdown editors, especially those that focus on academic writing, depend upon Pandoc, which attempts to be a universal document converter. The Pandoc documents do not make for particularly fun reading, but they are a good resource when digging into the weeds.\nGood places to start for the why and how of writing in plain text for academic writing is Kieran Healy’s The Plain Person’s Guide to Plain Text Social Science and Programming Historian’s lesson on Sustainable Authorship in Plain Text using Pandoc and Markdown.",

It is an essential resource that I continue to check whenever I am working in R and forget how to do things.\nMake sure that you get comfortable using the RStudio IDE, the app you use to run R. Check out the RStudio IDE User Guide if you encounter issues and to see what you can do in RStudio.\nA good tutorial on R from a Humanities/Social Sciences perspective is Data Carpentry - R for Social Scientists. Another good option is Software Carpentry - R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis. A more general intro to R from the perspective of someone more used to spreadsheets is Julie Lowndes and Allison Horst, R for Excel Users.\nPosit, the company that makes RStudio, publishes cheatsheets for the set of tidyverse packages we will be using during the course. If you have a question about R you can ask or look for similar questions on the Posit Community.\nIt might be useful to keep The tidyverse style guide handy as you are getting used to writing R code. It provides some basic tips for how to style your code to make it more consistent and easier to read.\nTwo great resources on visualization are Kieran Healy, Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction (Princeton University Press, 2018) and Claus Wilke, Fundamentals of Data Visualization (O’Reilly 2019). Both provide guidance on how to make effective visualizations for the Humanities and Social Sciences. Hadley Wickham, the creator of ggplot2, Danielle Navarro, and Thomas Lin Pedersen have a third edition of the book ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis. It is a very good reference.\nAnother set of great resources for visualization with ggplot2 are by Cédric Scherer. His blog post, A ggplot2 Tutorial for Beautiful Plotting in R is both a great starting point and great as a quick reference. His workshop, Graphic Design with ggplot2 at the 2022 RStudio conference is a really nice tutorial on making advanced visualizations.\nYou can also look at a series of notes/overviews that I have written on the tidyverse and visualization with ggplot2.\nTwo good ways to keep up with what is going on with R and the R community is to subscribe to the R Weekly RSS feed to get a curated list of posts about R. Another great project for learning R and seeing some examples is Tidy Tuesday a community driven weekly event to analyze and visualize a given data set. Because it is difficult to search for a single letter on the internet, the R community often used #rstats.",

    "text": "The solution\nThe solution is to break up the steps of making a map into separate scripts. We get and prep the data once. Then we can use the data to make as many maps as we want. This is good practice for thinking about how we should be dividing up scripts and when to save data compared to when we can recreate it through our R scripts.\nThere are two basic ways to do this:\n\nUse an R script within the website project folder to download and clean the data. An R script (named something like map-data.R) will not be rendered in the website by Quarto.\nDownload the data and potentially make the map in a separate RStudio project. You can either create the map in that project, save an image file, and then use the image on your website, or you can copy over the cleaned data files to website project to work on them there.\n\nEither way you decide to structure your project, there are four basic steps to follow:\n\nDownload the data.\nCheck that the data is correct and clean it up.\nSave the data; write it out to a data/ folder.\nRead in the data when you want to make a map.\n\nLet’s show how to do this for two different kinds of geographic data we will want to download from the internet: geocoded data and base map data.\nFirst we load the packages we are going to use.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidygeocoder)\nlibrary(sf, verbose = FALSE)\nlibrary(rnaturalearth)",

    "text": "Geocoded data\nGeocoding location data is something that we want to do once, make sure that it is correct, and then save the resulting data. It is not something we want to be doing multiple times.\nLet’s start by creating some data to geocode using tidygeocoder. If you have a larger data set with locations, you will want to create a csv file and read in the data.\n\nlocations &lt;- tibble(\n  name = c(\"Blacksburg\", \"San Diego\", \"Washington, DC\"),\n  address = c(\"Blacksburg, VA 24060\", \"San Diego, CA 92024\", \"Washington, DC 20024\")\n)\n\nNotice that we have two columns here, one for the label of our points/locations and one for the address, where we can be more exact about the location to geocode. We can geocode the data with the geocode() function since it is in a data frame. If you have your locations in a vector, you can use the geo() function.\n\nlocations_geo &lt;- geocode(locations, address = address)\n\nCheck to make sure that the geocoded data is correct. This can be done by just looking at the output or mapping it with a base map of mapview. Here we will just look at the output.\n\nlocations_geo\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 4\n  name           address                lat   long\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Blacksburg     Blacksburg, VA 24060  37.2  -80.4\n2 San Diego      San Diego, CA 92024   32.7 -117. \n3 Washington, DC Washington, DC 20024  38.9  -77.0\n\n\nThe next step is to save the data or write it out. It is easiest to do this before we convert the data to an sf object because we can use the normal write_csv() function from the tidyverse. This function takes the data we want to write out and the name of the file/location we want to create.\n\n# Save data frame to a csv file\nwrite_csv(locations_geo, \"data/locations-geo.csv\")\n\nThen, next time we want to use the data, we can just read it in.\n\nlocations_geo &lt;- read_csv(\"data/locations-geo.csv\")",

It is an sf object and so to maintain the geospatial nature of the data we need to use st_write() instead of write_csv() and to choose a type of spatial data to create. Here, we will use geojson. Otherwise the steps are the same.\nLet’s load some data from rnaturalearth. In this case, we will use the ne_states() function to load data for the states of the country “United States of America”.\n\nstates &lt;- ne_states(country = \"United States of America\")\n\nBefore saving the data, we want to clean it up and simplify it to only have the state name and to only include the continental United States.\n\nstates &lt;- states |&gt; \n  filter(name != \"Hawaii\", name != \"Alaska\") |&gt; \n  select(name)\n\nNow we can write out the data using the st_write() function as a geojson file. This will maintain all of the geographic metadata of our data such as the CRS.\n\nst_write(states, \"data/states.geojson\")\n\nThen, next time we want to use the data, we can just read it in, but this time with st_read() because we want an sf object.\n\nstates &lt;- st_read(\"data/states.geojson\")",

    "text": "What are the benefits of writing in plain text?\nWriting in plain text may seem odd at first, and it confronts the beginner with a number of issues compared to word processing applications such as Microsoft Word that use a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) interface. However, there are a number of advantages to using plain text documents that make the initial discomfort worth it.\n\nSustainability: Plain text documents are sustainable. They will be able to be read and displayed by a computer as long as we have such technology. They are not dependent on a proprietary format like docx.\nLight weight: Plain text documents are incredibly lightweight. Word processors add all sorts of formatting characters to provide a WYSIWYG experience that increase the file size and add complexity to the whole process of writing. Try opening a hundred page document in Word and then try opening the same document in a plain text editor. The latter will open instantaneously.\nThe power of a text editor: With a text editor application you can perform all sorts of complex search and search and replace functionality across multiple documents at the same time.\nThe web: The internet is created using plain text documents. If you want to write for the web, you should be writing in plain text.\nAdding formatting with markup languages: If the lack of formatting is a benefit, how do you get plain text documents to have the formatting you want in a document? The answer is to use a markup language. The markup language of the web is HTML, but other common markup languages used to write for academic purposes are Markdown, typst, and latex. With these markup languages you can create complex documents that serve the needs of academics well.",

Its popularity also means that it is easy to find applications that will render Markdown to styled text.\nMarkdown provides a good feature set for most types of historical writing: headings, lists, italic, bold, links, and footnotes gets you pretty far. It, thus, makes it much easier to write in plain text instead of with a world processor. See above for the benefits of plain text.\nMarkdown is the basis for RMarkdown and Quarto, the literate programming languages we will use in this course. This document is written in Markdown.",

    "text": "Why should I learn a programming language for data analysis and visualization?\nThere are many reasons why you might want to use a programming language for data analysis and visualization instead of spreadsheets or a GUI (graphical user interface) program, but first it is worth conceding that learning and using a programming language has a much steeper learning curve than the GUI alternatives. Nevertheless, this course argues that it is worth the effort. Benefits include:\n\nReproducibility: With a programming language you can document your analysis in a script that can be reproduced by others. This is not possible with a point-and-click interface of a GUI application or a spreadsheet. Excel error due to miss-clicking are well known.\nSeparation of data and analysis: In a spreadsheet your data and your analysis are done in the same place. This can make it easy to unknowingly introduce errors into your data. With a programming language all analysis is done on a copy of the data, making it easier to ensure the data is correct. This also has the benefit that you can can make mistakes in your data analysis with a programming language without consequence. If you run into problems, get an error, or mess something up, it is ok. Your data remains safe and sound just as you left it.\nYou are in charge: Spreadsheets often try to guess the formatting of data, which is another source of errors. Such errors are common, especially in dealing with dates. Scientists even had to rename a gene to deal with the issue. For historians, the fact that Excel does not natively support dates before 1900. With a programming language you have much greater control.",

    "text": "Why are we learning R in this course? Why not Python?\nIn this course we will learn R for data analysis and visualization. A reasonable question to ask is why R and why not Python. To begin with, I think it is fair to say that R and Python are both good choices for doing Digital Humanities. I should also say that the main reasons we are learning R in this course is that I am more comfortable with R than with Python. But there are a couple of reasons that I think R is a good choice for Digital Humanities.\n\nR is a domain specific programming language that was designed for Statistics. It was designed to work with data. The main types of rectangular data common to Digital Humanities is at home in R. Python is a more general programming language. This has some real benefits, but it also means that data analysis and visualization is not at the core of the language in the same way as is true for R.\nR is easier to install than Python, R packages are easier to manage than Python packages, and the RStudio IDE provides a first-class environment for data analysis.\nA strong, open, and welcoming community has been built around data analysis and reproducible research with R.

Two advantages of Quarto over RMarkdown are that Quarto can be used by more than just R and it provides a more consistent interface for writing a wide variety of outputs including R scripts, journal articles, slides, websites, and books.

It is useful to have a personal website that you can point people towards and that you can use as a showcase for you work. Or it can just be a place for you to do what you want.

    "text": "Resources\n\nText editors\nSee Resources: Text editors. A good text editor can save you a lot of time if you take the time to learn how to use it. A great and longstanding macOS text editor is BBEdit, which can be purchased, but it offers a very generous free mode. Here is a comparison chart of what you get with the free version. A classic text editor for Windows is Notepad++. A popular cross-platform text editor that is freely available is Visual Studio Code. There are many other options. Feel free to check them out.\n\n\nMarkdown\n\nJohn Gruber’s introduction of Markdown and its syntax\nProgramming Historian: Getting Started with Markdown\nMarkdown style guide: Quarto docs\nMarkdown Style Guide\nMany Markdown editors, especially those that focus on academic writing, depend upon Pandoc, which attempts to be a universal document converter.\n\nMarkdown syntax guide created in class\n\n\nOther markup options\n\nThe main other option for writing in Markdown or a Markdown based system is LaTeX. Overleaf is a LaTeX editor created specifically for collaboration in academia.\n\n\n\nNote taking apps and zettelkasten\nThere is currently a bit of a renaissance in note taking apps that are designed around the basic ideas of zettelkasten. Most of the apps are Markdown editors that provide a way to create internal links between your notes and display incoming and outgoing links. Zettlr is just one example. It is nice because it is open source, cross platform, and designed with academics in mind. But this does not mean that it is necessarily the best for you. Another hugely popular free (but not open source) and cross platform option is Obsidian.\n\n\nOther options\nDevonThink is more of a do it all database app for macOS, but it can certainly be used as the foundation of organizing your research and note taking.",

To copy citations instead of bibliography entries, use Edit → Copy Citation or Ctrl/Cmd-Shift-A. The citation style for export can be chosen in Zotero Settings under the Export tab.\nAn alternative is to right-click on selected items and choose “Create Bibliography from Selected Item(s)…” from the contextual menu. This will allow you to choose the citation style and how you want to create the bibliography.\n\nDealing with citation styles can be difficult, but Zotero comes with most styles that you will need.\n\nAll styles are written in Citation Style Language (CSL), which means they can be used and read by most tools built for creating citations and bibliographies.",
