title: "Week 14: Web design and visualization"

This week is a more or less free week to discuss and work on anything from the class that we feel we want/need to go over. The current idea for the week is to go over styling for websites and polishing visualizations.

## Publishing your website on GitHub pages
- See also [Resources: Publishing Quarto websites with GitHub Pages](/resources.qmd#sec-quarto-publish)
- Documentation for the [publish command](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#publish-command) using the quarto command line interface.

### Setting up publish command
1. First, **make sure all changes are committed** on your project.
2. Create an empty `gh-pages` branch.
    1. `git checkout --orphan gh-pages`
    2. `git reset --hard`
    3. `git commit --allow-empty -m "Initialising gh-pages branch"`
    4. `git push origin gh-pages`
3. Check Settings -> Pages for **Source** branch on your [GitHub](https://github.com) repository.
4. Ignore `_site/` folder in git
    1. Add `/_site/` to `.gitignore` file.
    2. Remove any tracking of `_site/` in git: `git rm -r _site`
5. Publish through command line: `quarto publish gh-pages`

### What you should be doing to make changes to your website
1. Make the changes in RStudio.
2. `git add` and `git commit -m` changes.
3. Push changes to GitHub main branch: `git push origin main`
4. Publish changes by pushing to gh-pages branch: `quarto publish gh-pages`
